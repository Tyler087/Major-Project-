#Major Project Proposal
##Tyler Smith 
###First Person Shooter Game

##Description
 For my major project I was planning on making a first person shooter game in processing. Its either going to consist of a background with
 enemies coming at you and getting bigger or having a special object on one side of the screen and have enemies at the other side run across
 to get at the object. You will shoot the enemies by clicking on them. Once they get so close to you or the object they will start taking down
 your life. I chose to make this because i enjoy playing first person shooter games and I feel i will have alot of fun creating one.
